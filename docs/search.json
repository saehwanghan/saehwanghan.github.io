Han’s current research interests center around examining health consequences of social and productive engagement in middle and later adulthood, with a particular focus on examining how various forms of helping behaviors (e.g., formal volunteering, informal helping, or caregiving) influence behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying health. Another stream of his research focuses on examining dyadic processes underlying coupled individuals’ health behaviors and health outcomes in mid- and late-life, demonstrating how individuals draw from one’s own and partners’ social relationships for the betterment of their health. Han’s research employs longitudinal data from national surveys, such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS).\n\nResearch Areas\n\nHuman Development\nRelationships, Families and Youth\n\n\n\nFields of Interest\n\nAdult Development\nAging\nBiobehavioral Processes and Health\nInterpersonal Relationships"
